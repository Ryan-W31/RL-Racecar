# RL-Racecar 🏎️

![](https://github.com/Ryan-W31/RL-Racecar/blob/main/assets/RL-Racecar-Demo.gif)

## Goal 🥇
Use reinforcement learning to find the fastest way around a track.
---
## Tools 🧰
- Python
- NEAT
- Pygame
---
## Challenges 📈
- I first started by trying to implement my own Q-Learning algorithm, but I did not get the results I was looking for.
- I had never used NEAT before, and learning how to use it took a bit of time.
- Pygame surfaces also took a while to get used to. I started by making the car just a surface, but ended up with it as a sprite.

## Results 🌟
- All goals were accomplished and the finished product can be used!

## Directions 📋
- Ensure that you have installed git and Python on your device.
- Open the terminal or GitHub Desktop and paste this command  ```https://github.com/Ryan-W31/RL-Racecar.git```
- Once the repo has been cloned, enter into the main project directory from the terminal.
- Create a virtual python envirnment using either Anaconda or virtualenv.
...virtualenv: 1. ```pip install virtualenv``` 2.```venv {envirnoment name}```
...Anaconda: 1. Install Anaconda 2.```conda create {envirnment name}```
-  Using pip, download the required packages using the requirements.txt
-  From the main project directory, paste this command in the terminal: ```python3 main.py```
...If you want to see the radars and checkpoints, use this command ```python3 main.py --debug```
- Enjoy!
